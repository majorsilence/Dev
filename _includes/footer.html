    <p class="bio">I love spending time with my family.  I am currently a software developer 
        at TownSuite specializing in release deployment and leading a full stack web development 
        team.  I love learning programming language and have used python, ruby, rust, io, prolog, java, c, c++, c#, vb, javascript, typescript, 
        bash, powershell and is currently focused on c# with asp.net core and typescript. 
        I am a huge advocate of open source software and love to use git, jenkins, docker and other tools related to automated deployments. </p>
