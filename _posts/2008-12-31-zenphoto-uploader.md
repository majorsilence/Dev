I found an interesting new program yesterday.  It is <a href="http://sanjuas.net/blog/2008/06/06/zpu-zenphoto-file-upload-utility/">zpu (ZenPhoto Uploader)</a>.  It is exactly what I was looking for.  It allows you to upload entire directories of photos without having to do it manually with the webform.  I know it can be down by ftp but I am using an easy one click install from dreamhost for simplicity and it only supports the web form upload process.

So zpu saved the day for me.  I had to make a few changes to make it work on Windows; they have since been included to become 0.2.  

I also am working on some GUI changes to make it nicer to work with.  Hopefully they will get included as well.
