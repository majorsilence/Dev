I got sick of the brokenness of the Ubuntu install that came with the dell mini, so like many others I have installed Ubuntu 8.10 to solve my problems.  And you know what?  It did solve all my problems.  Everything is now working.  I did have to touch a configuration file to enable sound, but compared to the problems with the system it came with it was well worth the five seconds that it took to enable audio.

So following instructions that were found on http://www.ubuntumini.com/ made the process very simple.  I wonder why dell is not able to do this.
