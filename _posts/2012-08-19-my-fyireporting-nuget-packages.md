I have started putting together some nuget packages for My-FyiReporting.  This should make it easier for those that wish to use the viewer or designer in their projects to setup everything.

At the moment I have the x86 package created.  It includes .NET 3.5 and 4.0 dlls and will auto setup for your project type.  See https://nuget.org/packages/My-FyiReporting.x86.

I do not have the 64 bit package created yet but when it is created you should be able to get it from  https://nuget.org/packages/My-FyiReporting.x64

These packages are a work in progress and currently still need a little work to make them perfect.
