I have ported the c# xwt samples to vb.net.  They are currently hosted at https://github.com/majorsilence/xwt in the SamplesVB folder.  I have no idea if they will be accepted into the main code.  If they are not I will create a branch in my fork and move the vb.net samples there for anyone that is interested.


The main .net xwt project is https://github.com/mono/xwt. 

"Xwt is a new .NET framework for creating desktop applications that run on multiple platforms from the same codebase. Xwt works by exposing one unified API across all environments that is mapped to a set of native controls on each platform."
