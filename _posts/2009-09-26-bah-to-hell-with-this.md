I am sick to death of using PyGTK on Windows.  It sucks, does not work very good, is not up to date and does not support the features that are in the latest versions of DeVeDe (3.14, gtkbuilder...).  I will be uploading a fixed version of 3.12.4 and hope that it works.  If it does work, good, if not I will not be doing anymore packages for DeVeDe until PyGTK is maintained properly for Windows.

I think I will be sticking to .NET development.  It is so much nicer.   Of course I will still be using PyGTK on linux.
