I have updated my warsetup fork to include a new option to execute an executable once the installation is finished.  What I would really like is the ability to setup custom actions through warsetup but this is the next best thing.  At least for what I need to do.

It is available in the <a href="https://github.com/majorsilence/WarSetup-Fork/downloads">downloads section</a> and in version 3.14.4 or above.
