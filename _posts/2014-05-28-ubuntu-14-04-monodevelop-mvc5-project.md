Creating a new mvc5 project on ubuntu 14.04 with the version of monodevelop (4.0.12) included is not fun.  It does not have an option for mvc 5 and when you attempt to create a mvc3 site there is an error stating it is missing templates needed to create the project.

To work around this and other problems I have created a base example project that I can use whenever I need a new mvc razor site.

The example site can be cloned from https://github.com/majorsilence/AspMvc5Mono.

If you want to host the site using nginx see https://www.majorsilence.com/ubuntu_14.04_mvc5_with_razor_and_nginx.
