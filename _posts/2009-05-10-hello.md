<h1>DeVeDe</h1><p>
I have not been doing to much work on devede lately as my main development machine has died.  I should be getting a new one shortly, but still it will probably be the summer before I get one.  No worries though, I will make sure I keep updating the installers to match the www.rastersoft.com linux devede releases.</p><h2>ZenPhoto Uploader</h2><p>Awhile ago I did some more work on this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly I should have some new windows installation packages put on my site (http://www.majorsilence.com/zpu).</p><h2>DreamHostAPI .NET Library</h2><p>The latest thing I have been working on is writing a .NET library (http://www.majorsilence.com/dreamhost) for the dreamhost api.&nbsp; This is mostly for practice as I need to use VB.NET at my new job.&nbsp; So creating a smiple library and GUI using VB is giving me some practice. This should work with mono.&nbsp; However for some reason the library is not.&nbsp; The gui does, but not the library.&nbsp; I will track this down.</p><p>I have also been writing a library and gui to convert project gutenberg text files to xml; and of course from xml to LaTeX and PDF.&nbsp; This has mostly been put to the side as I spend time on the dreamhost library.&nbsp; Put I have it were I should be able to clean it up and add detection for different parts of the file.&nbsp; Basically all it does now is detect primtive chapters and paragraphs.&nbsp; So with some work I can add better detection for chapters, qoutes, sections, table of contents, index, blah blah blah ....</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
