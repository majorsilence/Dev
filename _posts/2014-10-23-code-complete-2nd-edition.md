<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Code-Complete-2nd-Steve-McConnell/dp/0735619670/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1414104634&sr=8-1&keywords=code+complete">Code Complete (2nd Edition)</a> is ok.  I cannot remember much except I did like when I read it a few years ago.

It is large.  It took to long to read but I believe it had some good points.  

I recommend this book.  I wish it were smaller.
