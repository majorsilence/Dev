Since I have received my new Vista 64 computer I have been having problems with creating ISO files with DeVeDe.  To quickly fix this I have added support for ImgBurn (http://www.imgburn.com).  If ImgBurn is installed DeVeDe will use it to create the ISO file instead of mkisofs.

Using ImgBurn should also take care of the "ran out space errors" that some users have been experiencing.

I am currently testing it and within a couple of days there should be a DeVeDe 3.12.4 package uploaded.
