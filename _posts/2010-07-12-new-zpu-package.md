I have fixed some bugs to allow zpu to work with the latest ZenPhoto server software again.  I have committed the changes to the sourceforge.net svn repository (http://sourceforge.net/projects/zpu/develop) and built a new windows msi package.

The msi package can be downloaded from my site at http://majorsilence.com/zpu.
