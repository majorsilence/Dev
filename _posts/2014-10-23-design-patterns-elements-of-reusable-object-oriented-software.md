<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1414104634&sr=8-5&keywords=code+complete">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a> is a good book.  I had to read about 50 pages before I started to enjoy it.  

I recommend this book.
