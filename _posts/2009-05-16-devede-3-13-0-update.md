I was going to update the windows package of DeVeDe to 3.13.0 today but ran into a problem.  Unfortunately for now I will leave it at 3.12.2 because I need the most recent version of pygtk which has not been released for windows yet.  So it may be a few weeks before newer version of DeVeDe are uploaded, whenever a new version PyGTK is released.
