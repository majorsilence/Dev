I have just recently upgraded to windows 7.   As I am now only using windows 7 I will not be testing on window xp.  The good news is I should run into problems that people having noting they see on windows 7 and be able to fix them.

I have been testing and building devede on windows 7 today and it seems to be working much better.  Maybe I will upload a new installer soon.
