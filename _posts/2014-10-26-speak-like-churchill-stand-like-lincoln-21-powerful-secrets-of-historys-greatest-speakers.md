<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Speak-Like-Churchill-Stand-Lincoln/dp/0761563512/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1414358906&sr=8-1&keywords=speak+like+churchill+stand+like">Speak Like Churchill, Stand Like Lincoln: 21 Powerful Secrets of History's Greatest Speakers</a> is an ok book.  It has good advice when it comes to speeches.  It is under 200 pages - my favourite kind of book.
