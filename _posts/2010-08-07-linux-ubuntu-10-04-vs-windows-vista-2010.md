<p>Ubuntu 10.04 64bit Windows Vista 64bit SP2 Despite all the bad things I have heard people say about Vista I like it way better then any modern Linux when using it as a desktop system. All Linux <a href="http://distrowatch.com/">distros</a> I have ever tried all have the same basic flaws. One thing works on one distro but is broken on the next. Not one Linux distribution ever has everything working. Truthfully it is not always the distros fault; when it comes to audio I blame the application developers that are not using the standard APIs that they should be using (<a href="http://www.gstreamer.net/">gstreamer</a>). Even so, it does create a very unfriendly working environment. Overall I do like many of the programs on Linux much better then anything I have tried on windows. I prefer both <a href="http://banshee.fm/">banshee</a> and <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/">rhythmbox</a> over almost everything on windows. The only program that I have found for windows that I do like is <a href="http://www.atunes.org/">aTunes</a> which is a very nice player.</p>

<ul>
	<li>CD/DVD burning works with no errors every time (<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/">imgburn</a>)</li>
	<li>Visual Studio</li>
	<li>Audio works properly</li>
	<li>Working <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">flash</a></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Major Usability Problems </span></p>
<ul>
	<li>File operations extremely slow file operations. Copy, paste. Select two video files to retrieve the size takes 10 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Minor Usability Problems </span></p>
<ul>
	<li>No included bittorrent</li>
	<li>Insane menu structure.&nbsp; Items are grouped by company instead of task. All non Microsoft software must be updated manually</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><big>Linux Pro </big></span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Extremely fast file operations. Select two video files to retrieve the size is instance.</li>
	<li>Integrated multi protocol messaging (<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Empathy">empathy</a>). I am mainly concerned with Google talk and MSN and my wife also uses the face book chat.</li>
	<li>Virtual Desktops</li>
	<li>Sane menu structure. Items are grouped based on task and not company name.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><big>Linux Con </big></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Major Usability Problems </span></p>
<ul>
	<li>CD/DVD burning constant errors in burning software (<a href="http://projects.gnome.org/braser/">Brasero</a>). Discs burn fine but the software is always displaying an error.</li>
	<li>Broken audio. Works fine if all you do play music with the included player. If you do anything such as want to record audio with <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> or play 3d shooter such as <a href="http://alientrap.org/nexuiz/">Nexuiz</a> (both of which are included in Ubuntu&#39;s software list) it blocks all other sound. Not only does it block other sound but you have to restart other problem such as your music player afterwards.</li>
	<li>Default bittorrent client <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">transmission</a>. Lacking features. Way to many features lacking.</li>
	<li>Flash broken. Does not work properly. Has to use some sort of wrapper yet no controls on any sites work. No easy way to install 32bit browser like on windows.</li>
	<li>Screensaver never displays login prompt.&nbsp; Test with included ubuntu screensaver AntSpotlight.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Minor Usability Problems</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>Ships monodevelop with a broken debugger.&nbsp; Have to upgrade to an unoffical build to have a working debugger.&nbsp; This major but minor as most people will not see it (only developers) but still.&nbsp; How the hell does an ide ship with a non working debugger.</li>
</ul>
