I am creating an IronPython port of DeVeDe.  Progress can be tracked from:  
http://majorsilence.com/commitlog?repo=1

I am currently planning on keeping the IronPython port of DeVeDe in sync with the main DeVeDe.  I also still plan on packaging the main DeVeDe for Windows.

The IronPython port should have less problems with communicating with the underlying backed applications (IronPython has support for asynchronous sub-process communication built-in) and translations should work again.
