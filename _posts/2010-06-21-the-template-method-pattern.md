Read the chapter "The Template Method Pattern".  Had a hard time concentrating on this chapter.

To quote the book:  "Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Redefine the steps in an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure."  Design Patterns Explained chapter 18 page 283.
