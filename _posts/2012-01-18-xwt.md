I have been playing around some with xwt (https://github.com/mono/xwt).  I am looking forward to it reaching a release status.

Xwt is a cross platform (Window, Linux, Mac) toolkit for c#.  Write your application once and it is native on all platforms.  Nice.  

On windows it uses wpf, linux gtk, and mac cocoa.
