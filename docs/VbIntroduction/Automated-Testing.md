NUnit is a testing framework.  It is primarily designed to do unit testing but can be used to do other testing.  To use NUnit you must add references to the NUnit assemblies.

Go to http://www.nunit.org/ and install it.  If you are running on a 64 bit system you should make sure you run nunit-x86.exe if you have your project set to build as x86 instead of AnyCPU.
